	abstract = {Ocean acidiﬁcation (OA) is generally assumed to negatively impact calciﬁcation rates of marine organisms. At a local scale however, biological activity of macrophytes may generate pH ﬂuctuations with rates of change that are orders of magnitude larger than the long-term trend predicted for the open ocean. These ﬂuctuations may in turn impact benthic calciﬁers in the vicinity. Combining laboratory, mesocosm and ﬁeld studies, such interactions between OA, the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus, the sea grass Zostera marina and the blue mussel Mytilus edulis were investigated at spatial scales from decimetres to 100s of meters in the western Baltic. Macrophytes increased the overall mean pH of the habitat by up to 0.3 units relative to macrophytefree, but otherwise similar, habitats and imposed diurnal pH ﬂuctuations with amplitudes ranging from 0.3 to more than 1 pH unit. These amplitudes and their impact on mussel calciﬁcation tended to increase with increasing macrophyte biomass to bulk water ratio. At the laboratory and mesocosm scales, biogenic pH ﬂuctuations allowed mussels to maintain calciﬁcation even under acidiﬁed conditions by shifting most of their calciﬁcation activity into the daytime when biogenic ﬂuctuations caused by macrophyte activity offered temporal refuge from OA stress. In natural habitats with a low biomass to water body ratio, the impact of biogenic pH ﬂuctuations on mean calciﬁcation rates of M. edulis was less pronounced. Thus, in dense algae or seagrass habitats, macrophytes may mitigate OA impact on mussel calciﬁcation by raising mean pH and providing temporal refuge from acidiﬁcation stress.},

	abstract = {Biogenic, seasonal, and stochastic ﬂuctuations at various scales characterize coastal marine habitats and modulate environmental stress. The relevance of most past studies into climate change impacts is weakened by the usually intentional exclusion of ﬂuctuations from the experimental design. We describe a new outdoor mesocosm system for benthic research (“benthocosms”) which permit the control and manipulation of several environmental variables while admitting all natural in situ ﬂuctuations. This is achieved by continuously measuring the relevant variables (e.g., temperature, pH, O2, CO2) in situ, deﬁning these in real time as reference values in the control software and simulating target climates by delta treatments. The latter constitute the manipulative addition of predeﬁned changes (e.g., “warming”, “acidiﬁcation”) to the reference values. We illustrate the performance of the system by presenting the environmental data of four seasonal experiments which together represent an entire year. The “Kiel Outdoor Benthocosms” allow realizing nearnatural climate change experiments on complex benthic communities under controlled scenarios.},

The Baltic Sea is an ideal study site for such AT dynamics, due to its direct link to terrestrial processes, short water residence time and long history of AT measurements dating back to the early 20th century. We compiled an extensive AT data set that revealed the highest data quality and coverage for the past two decades. Within that period, surface water AT levels increased throughout the Baltic Sea. The rates of change were highest in the low-saline, northern areas and decreased gradually toward constant levels in the North Sea. The AT increase observed in the Central Baltic Sea (13.4 mmol kg21 yr21) and the Gulf of Bothnia (17 mmol kg21 yr21) has compensated CO2-induced acidiﬁcation by almost 50\% and 100\%, respectively. Further, the AT trends enhanced the CO2 storage capacity and stabilized the CaCO3 saturation state of the Baltic Sea over the past two decades. We discuss the attribution of the AT trends to potential changes in precipitation patterns, continental weathering driven by acidic rain and increasing atmospheric CO2, agricultural liming and internal AT sources.},

	abstract = {Spectrophotometric pH measurements were ﬁrst introduced for oceanic environments and they facilitated the determination of the marine CO2 system, including the direct observation of Ocean Acidiﬁcation. Extended characterizations of the indicator dye m-Cresol purple over the past two decades enabled the application of this method to natural waters ranging from brines to freshwaters. However, the required determination of the dye’s dissociation constants and absorbance properties were exclusively performed in buffer solutions prepared with artiﬁcial seawater. Potential perturbations by substances that occur in natural waters, but are not included in the buffer solutions, have never been tested. Therefore, we studied the impact of elevated amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S) on spectrophotometric pH measurements. We did not observe an impact on spectrophotometric pH measurements by H2S concentrations up to 400 lmol kg21, which reﬂect high levels such as those reported from the Black Sea. Likewise, natural DOM did not interfere with the spectrophotometric measurements at concentrations typical for oceanic environments and large estuarine systems. However, strongly colored river waters can cause spectral disturbances resulting in calculated pH values that are up to tenths of pH units too low. To circumvent such disturbances, we recommend using intense light sources, a shorter cuvette length or spectrophotometrically calibrated glass electrodes when performing spectrophotometric measurements under critical conditions.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have been conducted on the effect of ocean acidification on calcifiers inhabiting nearshore benthic habitats, such as the blue mussel \textit{Mytilus edulis}. The majority of these experiments was performed under stable CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ partial pressure (\textit{p}CO$_{\textrm{2}}$), carbonate chemistry and oxygen (O$_{\textrm{2}}$) levels, reflecting present or expected future open ocean conditions. Consequently, levels and variations occurring in coastal habitats, due to biotic and abiotic processes, were mostly neglected, even though these variations largely override global long-term trends. To highlight this hiatus and guide future research, state-of-the-art technologies were deployed to obtain high-resolution time series of \textit{p}CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and [O$_{\textrm{2}}$] on a mussel patch within a \textit{Zostera marina} seagrass bed, in Kiel Bay (western Baltic Sea) in August and September 2013. Combining the in situ data with results of discrete sample measurements, a full seawater carbonate chemistry was derived using statistical models. An average \textit{p}CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ more than 50\&amp;thinsp;\% ({\textasciitilde}\&amp;thinsp;640\&amp;thinsp;µatm) higher than current atmospheric levels was found right above the mussel patch. Diel amplitudes of \textit{p}CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ were large: 765\&amp;thinsp;±\&amp;thinsp;310 (mean\&amp;thinsp;±\&amp;thinsp;SD). Corrosive conditions for calcium carbonates (\&amp;Omega;$_{\textrm{arag}}$ and \&amp;Omega;$_{\textrm{calc}}$\&amp;thinsp;{\textless}\&amp;thinsp;1) centered on sunrise were found, but the investigated habitat never experienced hypoxia throughout the study period. It is estimated that mussels experience conditions limiting calcification for 12\&amp;ndash;15\&amp;thinsp;h per day, based on a regional calcium carbonate concentration physiological threshold. Our findings call for more extensive experiments on the impact of fluctuating corrosive conditions on mussels. We also stress the complexity of the interpretation of carbonate chemistry time series data in such dynamic coastal environments.},

Three sensing materials designed for seawater measurements are optimized with respect to dynamic measurement range and long-term stability. The spectral properties of the sensing materials were tailored to be compatible with a commercially available laboratory oxygen logger that was ﬁtted into a pressure housing. Interchangeable sensor caps with appropriate “sensing chemistry” are conveniently attached to the end of the optical ﬁber. This approach allows using the same instrument for multiple analytes, which offers great ﬂexibility and minimizes hardware costs. Applications of the new optode system were demonstrated by recording depth proﬁles for the three parameters during a research cruise in the Baltic Sea and by measuring surface water transects of pH. The optode was furthermore used to monitor the concentration of dissolved oxygen in a seagrass meadow in the Limfjord, Denmark, and sensor packages consisting of pO2, pH, and pCO2 were deployed in the harbors of Kiel, Germany, and Southampton, England, for 6 d. The measurements revealed that the system can resolve typical patterns in seawater chemistry related to spatial heterogeneities as well as temporal changes caused by biological and tidal activity.},

Compared with the biological carbon transformations, the impacts of air–sea fluxes and temperature changes on {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{p}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} were small, with their contributions to the monthly medians of diurnal {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{p}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} variability being up to 12 and 5 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}µ{\textless}/span{\textgreater}atm, respectively.

In this study, we use 8 years of carbon dioxide ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) and methane ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) observations from SOOP \textit{Finnmaid} to study the influence of upwelling on trace gas dynamics in the Baltic Sea. Between spring and autumn, coastal upwelling transports water masses enriched with {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} to the surface of the Baltic Sea. We study the seasonality, regional distribution, relaxation, and interannual variability in this process. We use reanalysed wind and modelled sea surface temperature (SST) data in a newly established statistical upwelling detection method to identify major upwelling areas and time periods. Large upwelling-induced SST decrease and trace gas concentration increase are most frequently detected around August after a long period of thermal stratification, i.e. limited exchange between surface and underlying waters. We found that these upwelling events with large SST excursions shape local trace gas dynamics and often lead to near-linear relationships between increasing trace gas levels and decreasing temperature. Upwelling relaxation is mainly driven by mixing, modulated by air–sea gas exchange, and possibly primary production. Subsequent warming through air–sea heat exchange has the potential to enhance trace gas saturation. In 2015, quasi-continuous upwelling over several months led to weak summer stratification, which directly impacted the observed trace gas and SST dynamics in several upwelling-prone areas. Trend analysis is still prevented by the observed high variability, uncertainties from data coverage, and long water residence times of 10–30 years. We introduce an extrapolation method based on trace gas–SST relationships that allows us to estimate upwelling-induced trace gas fluxes in upwelling-affected regions. In general, the surface water reverses from {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CO$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} sink to source, and {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}CH$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} outgassing is intensified as a consequence of upwelling. We conclude that SOOP data, especially when combined with other data sets, enable flux quantification and process studies addressing the process of upwelling on large spatial and temporal scales.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Common unresolved challenges remain for implementation of these models across RiOMar and OceMar systems. The long-term trends in coastal ocean carbon fluxes for different coastal systems under anthropogenic stress that are emerging in observations and numerical simulations are highlighted.

The data for the now 13 GLODAP core variables (salinity, oxygen, nitrate, silicate, phosphate, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, pH, chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11), CFC-12, CFC-113, CCl{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{4}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, and SF{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{6}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) have undergone extensive quality control with a focus on systematic evaluation of bias. The data are available in two formats: (i) as submitted by the data originator but converted to World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) exchange format and (ii) as a merged data product with adjustments applied to minimize bias. For the present annual update, adjustments for the 96 new cruises were derived by comparing those data with the data from the 989 quality-controlled cruises in the GLODAPv2.2021 data product using crossover analysis. SF{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{6}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} data from all cruises were evaluated by comparison with CFC-12 data measured on the same cruises. For nutrients and ocean carbon dioxide (CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) chemistry comparisons to estimates based on empirical algorithms provided additional context for adjustment decisions.

The compiled and adjusted data product is believed to be consistent to better than 0.005 in salinity, 1 \% in oxygen, 2 \% in nitrate, 2 \% in silicate, 2 \% in phosphate, 4 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}µmol{\textless}/span{\textgreater} kg{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} in dissolved inorganic carbon, 4 {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}µmol{\textless}/span{\textgreater} kg{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} in total alkalinity, 0.01–0.02 in pH (depending on region), and 5 \% in the halogenated transient tracers.

	abstract = {The ocean has absorbed 25 ± 2\% of the total anthropogenic CO2 emissions from the early 1960s to the late 2010s, with rates more than tripling over this period and with a mean uptake of –2.7 ± 0.3 Pg C year–1 for the period 1990 through 2019. This growth of the ocean sink matches expectations based on the increase in atmospheric CO2, but research has shown that the sink is more variable than long assumed. In this Review, we discuss trends and variations in the ocean carbon sink. The sink stagnated during the 1990s with rates hovering around –2 Pg C year–1, but strengthened again after approximately 2000, taking up around –3 Pg C year–1 for 2010–2019. The most conspicuous changes in uptake occurred in the high latitudes, especially the Southern Ocean. These variations are caused by changes in weather and climate, but a volcanic eruption-induced reduction in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate and the associated global cooling contributed as well. Understanding the variability of the ocean carbon sink is crucial for policy making and projecting its future evolution, especially in the context of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change stocktaking activities and the deployment of CO2 removal methods. This goal will require a global-level effort to sustain and expand the current observational networks and to better integrate these observations with models.},

The goal is to provide accurate pCO2 data to within 2 micro atmosphere (μatm) for surface ocean and 0.2 parts per million (ppm) for MBL measurements following rigorous best practices, calibration and intercomparison procedures. Platforms and data will be tracked in near real-time and final quality-controlled data will be provided to the community within a year. The network, involving partners worldwide, will aid in production of important products such as maps of monthly resolved surface ocean CO2 and air-sea CO2 flux measurements. These products and other derivatives using surface ocean and MBL CO2 data, such as surface ocean pH maps and MBL CO2 maps, will be of high value for policy assessments and socio-economic decisions regarding the role of the ocean in sequestering anthropogenic CO2 and how this uptake is impacting ocean health by ocean acidification. SOCONET has an open ocean emphasis but will work with regional (coastal) networks. It will liaise with intergovernmental science organizations such as Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW), and the joint committee for and ocean and marine meteorology (JCOMM).

	abstract = {The oceanic storage of anthropogenic CO
(C) that humans have emitted into the atmosphere has
been pivotal for counteracting climate change. Yet multi-decadal trends
in the ocean interior storage of C have not been
assessed at global scale. Here, we determine storage changes of
C by applying the eMLR(C*) regression method to ocean
interior observations collected between 1989 and 2020. We find that the
global ocean storage of C grew by 29 ± 3 Pg C
dec and 27 ± 3 Pg C dec (±1σ)
from 1994 to 2004 and 2004 to 2014, respectively. Although the two
growth rates are not significantly different, they imply a reduction of
the oceanic uptake fraction of the anthropogenic emissions from 36 ± 4
\% to 27 ± 3 \% from the first to the second decade. We attribute this
reduction to a decrease of the ocean buffer capacity and changes in
ocean circulation. In the Atlantic Ocean, the maximum storage rate
shifted from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere, plausibly caused
by a weaker formation rate of North Atlantic Deep Waters and an
intensified ventilation of mode and intermediate waters in the Southern
Hemisphere. Between 1994 and 2004, the oceanic C
accumulation exceeded the net air-sea flux by 8 ± 4 Pg C
dec, suggesting a loss of natural carbon from the
ocean during this decade. Our results reveal a substantial sensitivity
of the ocean carbon sink to climate variability and change.},

	abstract = {As a contribution to the Regional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes
phase 2 (RECCAP2) project, we present synthesized estimates of Arctic
Ocean sea-air CO2 fluxes and their uncertainties from 8 surface ocean
pCO2-observation products, 18 ocean biogeochemical hindcast and data
assimilation models and 6 atmospheric inversions. For the period of
1985−2018, the Arctic Ocean was a net sink of CO2 of 116 ± 4 TgC yr−1 in
the pCO2 products and 92 ± 30 TgC yr−1 in the models. The CO2 uptake
peaks in late summer and early autumn, and is low in winter when sea ice
inhibits sea-air fluxes. The long-term mean CO2 uptake in the Arctic
Ocean is primarily caused by steady-state fluxes of natural carbon (70 ±
15 \%), and enhanced by the atmospheric CO2 increase (19 ± 5 \%) and
climate change (11 ± 18 \%). The annual mean CO2 uptake increased from
1985 to 2018 at a rate of 31 ±13 TgC yr−1dec-1 in the pCO2 products and
10 ± 4 TgC yr−1dec-1 in the models. Moreover, 77 ± 38 \% of the trend in
the net CO2 uptake over time is caused by climate change, primarily due
to rapid sea ice loss in recent years. Both, the mean CO2 uptake and the
trend, is substantially weaker in the atmospheric inversions.
Uncertainties across all estimates are large, in the pCO2 products
because of scarcity of observations and in the models because of missing
processes.},

	abstract = {The coastal ocean contributes to regulating atmospheric greenhouse gas
concentrations by taking up carbon dioxide (CO2) and releasing nitrous
oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Major advances have improved our
understanding of the coastal air-sea exchanges of these three gasses
since the first phase of the Regional Carbon Cycle Assessment and
Processes (RECCAP in 2013), but a comprehensive view that integrates the
three gasses at the global scale is still lacking. In this second phase
(RECCAP2), we quantify global coastal ocean fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4
using an ensemble of global gap-filled observation-based products and
ocean biogeochemical models. The global coastal ocean is a net sink of
CO2 in both observational products and models, but the magnitude of the
median net global coastal uptake is {\textasciitilde}60\% larger in
models (-0.72 vs. -0.44 PgC/yr, 1998-2018, coastal ocean area of 77
million km2). We attribute most of this model-product difference to the
seasonality in sea surface CO2 partial pressure at mid- and
high-latitudes, where models simulate stronger winter CO2 uptake. The
global coastal ocean is a major source of N2O (+0.70 PgCO2-e /yr in
observational product and +0.54 PgCO2-e /yr in model median) and of CH4
(+0.21 PgCO2-e /yr in observational product), which offsets a
substantial proportion of the net radiative effect of coastal
{\textbackslash}co uptake (35-58\% in CO2-equivalents). Data products
and models need improvement to better resolve the spatio-temporal
variability and long term trends in CO2, N2O and CH4 in the global
coastal ocean.},

	abstract = {The ocean is a major carbon sink and takes up 25-30\% of the
anthropogenically emitted CO2. A state-of-the-art method to quantify
this sink are global ocean biogeochemistry models (GOBMs) but their
simulated CO2 uptake differs between models and is systematically lower
than estimates based on statistical methods using surface ocean pCO2 and
interior ocean measurements. Here, we provide an in-depth evaluation of
ocean carbon sink estimates from 1980 to 2018 from a GOBM ensemble. As
sources of inter-model differences and ensemble-mean biases our study
identifies the (i) model set-up, such as the length of the spin-up, the
starting date of the simulation, and carbon fluxes from rivers and into
sediments, (ii) the ocean circulation, such as Atlantic Meridional
Overturning Circulation and Southern Ocean mode and intermediate water
formation, and (iii) the oceanic buffer capacity. Our analysis suggests
that the late starting date and biases in the ocean circulation cause a
too low anthropogenic CO2 uptake across the GOBM ensemble. Surface ocean
biogeochemistry biases might also cause simulated anthropogenic fluxes
to be too low but the current set-up prevents a robust assessment. For
simulations of the ocean carbon sink, we recommend in the short-term to
(1) start simulations in 1765, when atmospheric CO2 started to increase,
(2) conduct a sufficiently long spin-up such that the GOBMs reach
steady-state, and (3) provide key metrics for circulation,
biogeochemistry, and the land-ocean interface. In the long-term, we
recommend improving the representation of these metrics in the GOBMs.},
